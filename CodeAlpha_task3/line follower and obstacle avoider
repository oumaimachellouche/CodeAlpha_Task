Line Follower and Obstacle Avoiding Robot (Arduino – Wokwi Simulation)

📖 Description

This project is an Arduino-based robot that combines line following and obstacle avoidance behaviors.
The robot follows a black line using IR sensors and automatically avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor.
The entire circuit and logic were simulated using Wokwi.

⚙️ Features

Line following using IR sensors

Obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensor

LCD display (optional, if you used it)

Fully simulated in Wokwi

🧰 Components Used

Arduino Mega

IR Line Tracking Sensors

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

Buzzer (Active)

LCD 16x2 with I2C (if used)

Jumper Wires

🔌 Circuit

The circuit was built and tested using Wokwi Online Simulator.

🧠 How It Works

IR sensors detect the line and guide the robot movement.

The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance.

When an obstacle is detected:

The robot stops
