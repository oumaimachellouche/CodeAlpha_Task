Line Follower & Obstacle Avoider Robot (Wokwi Simulation)

📌 Project Overview

This project presents a Line Follower and Obstacle Avoider Robot simulated using the Wokwi online simulator.
The robot is capable of autonomously following a predefined line while also detecting and avoiding obstacles in its path.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate basic autonomous navigation, sensor-based decision making, and motor control using an embedded system in a simulated environment.

🧠 Techniques Used

Line detection using IR sensors

Obstacle detection using an ultrasonic sensor

Conditional decision logic

Priority-based behavior (obstacle avoidance over line following)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Arduino (simulated)

Wokwi Simulator

 Arduino IDE logic
